# processing-project

## Project Description
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.

Processing was initially released with a `Java`-based syntax, and with a lexicon of graphical primitives that took inspiration from `OpenGL`, `Postscript`, Design by Numbers, and other sources. With the gradual addition of alternative progamming interfaces — including `JavaScript`, `Python`, and `Ruby` — it has become increasingly clear that **Processing** is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to learning, teaching, and making things with code.
